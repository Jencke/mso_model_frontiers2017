    This is a convenience function to easily
    run a brian network while also offering a flexible
    way of introducing Monitors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    duration : float
        Duration of the simulation in seconds.

    objects : list
        A collection of Brian objects to be simulated.

    export_dict : dict
        A dictionary of state trace to export. The Key gives
        the neuron group to read the state from and the value
        is a list of strings naming the state variables.
        {neuron1:['v', 'n']} for example would create state
        monitors for the variables v and n of neuron1

    **kwargs :
       Further kwargs ar passed to the brian network run function

    Returns
    -------
    If export_dict is given as a kwarg, The function this dictionary
    where the keys has been replaced by a pandas.DataFrame that contains
    the time and value treaces of the requested variables.
