    This function will generate a pure tone with of a given duration
    at a given sampling rate. By default, the first sample will be
    evaluated at 0 and the duration will be the real stimulus duration.

    if endpoint is set to True, the duration will be considerd
    as the maxium point in time so that the function calculates one
    more sample. The stimulus duration is now duration + (1. / fs)

    Parameters:
    -----------
    frequency : scalar
        The tone frequency in Hz.
    duration : scalar
        The tone duration in seconds.
    fs : scalar
        The sampling rate for the tone.
    start_phase : scalar, optional
        The starting phase of the sine tone.
    endpoint : bool, optional
        Whether to generate an additional sample so that
        duration = time at last sample.
